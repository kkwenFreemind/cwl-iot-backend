/**
 * IoT Metric Definition Update Form
 *
 * This form class encapsulates the data structure for updating existing IoT metric definitions
 * in a multi-tenant environment. It implements partial update semantics where null fields
 * are ignored during the update process, enabling flexible and selective modifications.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - Supports partial updates with selective field modification
 * - Implements comprehensive input validation using Bean Validation annotations
 * - Provides clear error messages for validation failures
 * - Maintains data integrity through field-level constraints
 * - Enables department-scoped metric definition management
 *
 * Architectural Role:
 * - Acts as the boundary object between client requests and service layer
 * - Provides input validation and sanitization before business logic processing
 * - Supports REST API request body deserialization and validation
 * - Enables type-safe data transfer with compile-time validation
 *
 * Update Semantics:
 * - Null fields are preserved (not updated) in the target entity
 * - Non-null fields replace existing values in the target entity
 * - Validation is performed only on non-null fields
 * - Supports conditional updates based on field presence
 *
 * Validation Strategy:
 * - Field-level validation using Jakarta Bean Validation annotations
 * - Custom validation messages for user-friendly error reporting
 * - Size constraints to prevent data truncation and buffer overflows
 * - Type safety through enum-based fields for categorical data
 *
 * Business Logic Integration:
 * - Compatible with optimistic locking for concurrent update protection
 * - Supports audit trail generation for change tracking
 * - Enables business rule validation in the service layer
 * - Facilitates integration with external validation frameworks
 *
 * Usage Scenarios:
 * - REST API PUT/PATCH endpoints for metric definition updates
 * - Administrative interfaces for metric configuration management
 * - Batch update operations for multiple metric definitions
 * - Integration with external systems requiring metric modifications
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Input sanitization prevents injection attacks
 * - Field-level validation prevents malformed data submission
 * - Size limits protect against denial-of-service through large payloads
 * - Type constraints ensure data integrity and system stability

     * Use Cases:
     * - Short labels in dashboard widgets and monitoring displays
     * - Technical identifiers for API integrations and data exports
     * - Abbreviations in protocol messages and data transmission
     * - Compact naming in mobile applications and responsive designs
     *
     * Update Scenarios:
     * - Adding an alias to a metric that previously had none
     * - Changing an existing alias to a more appropriate abbreviation
     * - Removing an alias by setting it to an empty string
     * - Standardizing aliases across related metrics
     *
     * Best Practices:
     * - Use consistent abbreviation patterns within the organization
     * - Consider the target audience when choosing alias formats
     * - Document alias meanings for maintenance and onboarding
     * - Avoid overly cryptic abbreviations that reduce clarity
